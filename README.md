## Features

### The Macro

A macro will run every time you leave a singleplayer world. You can prevent this macro from running by holding escape on your keyboard.

Multiple different macro options:
- 1.16
- 1.14/1.15
- 1.14/1.15 Hardcore (this one is for that korbanoes guy)

### World Deletion

With this feature enabled, whenever the macro runs, it will automatically delete all your worlds except for the most recent 5 worlds (which are kept for submission).

**To prevent a world from getting deleted, you can add safety to it by using the "Manage Safe Worlds" button.**
